## Not only java

Knowing multiple languages is good
- more flexible
- most concepts can be used in multiple languages
- makes learning other languages more easy
- it suggested in the first chapter [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.bol.com/nl/f/the-pragmatic-programmer-from-journeyman-to-master/9200000033027844/)

## Node

Don't kow much about it but:
- run js server site
- currently only option serverless on google
- since fast to start probably preferable for serverless compared to java

## Rust

Maybe next year because:
- use all of c, but safe
- can compile to web assembly

## Ponylang

Still very new but:
- when compiles your sure it's working (mathematically proofed)
- actor model fixes all your concurrency problems

[Mentions Pony as promising near the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVheDbrQBDk&list=PLRsbF2sD7JVqZ4RpHYkqSuCNhxumGP5eo&index=78)

## Elm

A front-end language which compiles to js but:
- using a type system and strict checking almost eliminated runtime exceptions
- had it's own runtime which at least in some cases is a lot faster then react/angular
- interop with js has to be done using ports
- not much tooling/libraries available
- releases often break things but it's easy and well documented

## Elixir

An easier way to use Erlang

Phoenix a web framework written in Elixir, has apparently when of the best websocket implementations.

Because of this it was used for the RIG instead of Rust.

## Cypher query language

For use with Neo4J graph database.
When a lot of relations are involve din the query performs much faster then sql.

## Kotlin

Just a less verbose java?

Some utility also in Spring.
